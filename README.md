On this challenge I was suppose to build the backend of a social network. I understood most of the code, I have a general understanding of the routes, and understood how MongoDB operated. However, I did have a misunderstanding of the general assignment. I had trouble picturing what I need to do without a frontend. Unfortnently I ended up stuck, and changing over the work I hvae already done.
